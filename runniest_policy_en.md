## Runniest - Information

This app will help you to arrange your running training. If you forever want to start running, but don’t know how - this is an app for you.

There are 12 steps to prepare you for non stop 20 minutes running. Each step you can do for a week (if you run every day) or month (if you run irregularly). If step is too easy for you - continue to the next step. If it is too diffucult - repeat it longer (may be not a week or a month, but longer).

There are all 12 steps in the main screen. You can work with any of them, but it is better to train yourself step by step. Each step (including those you don’t buy), have comment like “2/3+1:4”. First number before symbol “/” denotes amount of running minutes. Number that stays after symbol “/” denotes walking minutes. If there is an equation like “3+1” after the symbol “/” it means, there are 3 minutes of fast walking and 1 minute of slow walking. If there is not symbol “+” in equation after symbol “/”, then it is regular walking minutes count. After symbol “:” there is repetition count - number of repetitions of that program. If there are several such records, you should do it sequentially, repeating first all repetitions of first, then second.

For your convinience in the screen of each step there is a button called “Start”, which automatically form device notifications which tell you when start running a walking step by step with notification in notification center and sound signal “horn”.
